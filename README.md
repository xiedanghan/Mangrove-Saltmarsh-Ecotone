# Mangrove-Saltmarsh-Ecotone
_Mangrove-Saltmarsh-Ecotone_ is a modelling study investigating the effects of biotic interactions (i.e., competition and herbivory) on mangrove-saltmarsh ecotone dynamics and the eco-morphodynamic feedback between vegetation dynamics and morphological changes. 
The research has been published in _Earth's Future_ and can be freely accessed through https://doi.org/10.1029/2024EF004990.
To use the model, please follow the instructions on the [Technical Document](Technical_Documents.pdf).
